Chapter 1 gives a general survey of the topic with brief comments on the signi?cance of the aspects involved. This serves as a kind of a program for the following chapters. The central issues in this book are predictions of fatigue properties and designing against fatigue. These objectives cannot be realized without a physical and mechanical understanding of all relevant conditions. In Chapter 2 the book starts with basic concepts of what happens in the material of a structure under cyclic loads. It illustrates the large number of variables which can affect fatigue properties and it provides the essential background knowledge for subsequent chapters. Different subjects are presented in the following main parts: • Basic chapters on fatigue properties and predictions (Chapters 2–8) • Load spectra and fatigue under variable-amplitude loading (Chapters 9–11) • Fatigue tests and scatter (Chapters 12 and 13) • Special fatigue conditions (Chapters 14–17) • Fatigue of joints and structures (Chapters 18–20) • Fiber-metal laminates (Chapter 21) Each chapter presents a discussion of a speci?c subject.",J.

"The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements",$13.99,4.5,"From New York Times bestselling author Sam Kean comes incredible stories of science, history, finance, mythology, the arts, medicine, and more, as told by the Periodic Table. Why did Gandhi hate iodine (I, 53)? How did radium (Ra, 88) nearly ruin Marie Curie's reputation? And why is gallium (Ga, 31) the go-to element for laboratory pranksters? The Periodic Table is a crowning scientific achievement, but it's also a treasure trove of adventure, betrayal, and obsession. These fascinating tales follow every element on the table as they play out their parts in human history, and in the lives of the (frequently) mad scientists who discovered them. The Disappearing Spoon masterfully fuses science with the classic lore of invention, investigation, and discovery -- from the Big Bang through the end of time.

Artificial Chemistries (The MIT Press),$59.80,5,"An introduction to the fundamental concepts of the emerging field of Artificial Chemistries, covering both theory and practical applications.The field of Artificial Life (ALife) is now firmly established in the scientific world, but it has yet to achieve one of its original goals: an understanding of the emergence of life on Earth. The new field of Artificial Chemistries draws from chemistry, biology, computer science, mathematics, and other disciplines to work toward that goal. For if, as it has been argued, life emerged from primitive, prebiotic forms of self-organization, then studying models of chemical reaction systems could bring ALife closer to understanding the origins of life. In Artificial Chemistries (ACs), the emphasis is on creating new interactions rather than new materials.

University Chemistry: Frontiers and Foundations from a Global and Molecular Perspective,$67.99,5,"A new approach to teaching university-level chemistry that links core concepts of chemistry and physical science to current global challenges.Introductory chemistry and physics are generally taught at the university level as isolated subjects, divorced from any compelling context. Moreover, the “formalism first” teaching approach presents students with disembodied knowledge, abstract and learned by rote. By contrast, this textbook presents a new approach to teaching university-level chemistry that links core concepts of chemistry and physical science to current global challenges. It provides the rigorous development of the principles of chemistry but places these core concepts in a global context to engage developments in technology, energy production and distribution, the irreversible nature of climate change, and national security. Each chapter opens with a “Framework” section that establishes the topic’s connection to emerging challenges. Next, the “Core” section addresses concepts including the first and second law of thermodynamics, entropy, Gibbs free energy, equilibria, acid-base reactions, electrochemistry, quantum mechanics, molecular bonding, kinetics, and nuclear. Finally, the “Case Studies” section explicitly links the scientific principles to an array of global issues. These case studies are designed to build quantitative reasoning skills, supply the technology background, and illustrate the critical global need for the infusion of technology into energy generation. The text’s rigorous development of both context and scientific principles equips students for advanced classes as well as future involvement in scientific and societal arenas.

"Survivable Networks: Algorithms for Diverse Routing (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science, 477)",$163.54,5,"Survivable Networks: Algorithms for Diverse Routing provides algorithms for diverse routing to enhance the survivability of a network. It considers the common mesh-type network and describes in detail the construction of physically disjoint paths algorithms for diverse routing. The algorithms are developed in a systematic manner, starting with shortest path algorithms appropriate for disjoint paths construction. Key features of the algorithms are optimality and simplicity. Although the algorithms have been developed for survivability of communication networks, they are in a generic form, and thus applicable in other scientific and technical disciplines to problems that can be modeled as a network.  A notable highlight of this book is the consideration of real-life telecommunication networks in detail. Such networks are described not only by nodes and links, but also by the actual physical elements, called span nodes and spans. The sharing of spans (the actual physical links) by the network (logical) links complicates the network, requiring new algorithms. This book is the first one to provide algorithms for such networks.

"Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach, Second Edition",$45.88,4.4,"An Update of the Most Practical A-to-Z Operating System BookWidely lauded for avoiding the typical black box approach found in other operating system textbooks, the first edition of this bestselling book taught readers how an operating system works and explained how to build it from the ground up. Continuing to follow a logical pattern for system design, Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach, Second Edition removes the mystery from operating system design and consolidates the body of material into a systematic discipline. It presents a hierarchical design paradigm that organizes major operating system components in an orderly, understandable manner. The book guides readers through the construction of a conventional process-based operating system using practical, straightforward primitives. It gives the implementation details of one set of primitives, usually the most popular set. Once readers understand how primitives can be implemented on conventional hardware, they can then easily implement alternative versions.The text begins with a bare machine and proceeds step-by-step through the design and implementation of Xinu, which is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O functions.

Operating Systems: Concepts,$4.04,4.3,"The main software when using the computer is the operating system. The operating system defines all the experiences when using a computer; it manages the hardware and software resources of the computer system, provides a way for applications to deal with the hardware without having to know all the details of the hardware, and it is the software that makes all the programs work. It organizes and controls the hardware on computers. The operating system is the first software we see when we turn on the computer, and the last software we see when the computer is turned off.The operating system plays the role of the good parent, making sure that each application gets the necessary resources while playing nicely with all the other applications, as well as husbanding the limited capacity of the system for the greatest good of all the users and applications. Even if a particular computer is unique, an operating system can ensure that applications continue to run when hardware upgrades and updates occur.",G.

"Real-time Operating Systems Book 2 - The Practice: Using STM Cube, FreeRTOS and the STM32 Discovery Board (Engineering of Real-Time Embedded Systems)",$30.00,4.1,"There’s something really satisfying about turning theory into practice, bringing with it a great feeling of accomplishment. Moreover it usually deepens and solidifies your understanding of the theoretical aspects of the subject, while at the same time eliminating misconceptions and misunderstandings. So it’s not surprising that the the fundamental philosophy of this book is that ‘theory is best understood by putting it into practice’. Well, that’s fine as it stands. Unfortunately the practice may a bit more challenging, especially in the field of real-time operating systems. First, you need a sensible, practical toolset on which to carry out the work. Second, for many self-learners, cost is an issue; the tools mustn’t be expensive. Third, they mustn’t be difficult to get, use and maintain. So what we have here is our approach to providing you with a low cost toolset for RTOS experimentation.The toolset used for this work consists of:A graphical tool for configuring microcontrollers (specifically STM32F variants) - STM32CubeMX software application.An Integrated Development Environment for the production of machine code.A very low cost single board computer with inbuilt programmer and debuggerAll software, which is free, can be run on Windows, OSX or Linux platforms. The Discovery kit is readily available from many electronic suppliers. The RTOS used for this work is FreeRTOS, which is integrated with the CubeMX tool. Now for a word of caution and advice. If you want to learn about the fundamentals of Real-Time Operating Systems, this is not the book for you. For that you need to study the material contained in Book 1 (or an equivalent textbook). This book assumes that you are fully conversant with that level of theory.The author: Jim Cooling has had many years experience in the area of real-time embedded systems, including electronic, software and system design, project management, consultancy, education and course development. He has published extensively on the subject, his books covering many aspects of embedded-systems work such as real-time interfacing, programming, software design and software engineering. Currently he is a partner in Lindentree Associates (which he formed in 1998), providing consultancy and training for real-time embedded systems.See: www.lindentreeuk.co.uk",Jim Cooling,https://www.amazon.com/Real-time-Operating-Systems-Book-Discovery/dp/1973409933/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=operating+system+for+engineering+books&qid=1680596153&s=books&sr=1-4

Compiler Design Using Java(R): An Object-Oriented Approach,$44.95,5,"This book is designed primarily for use as a textbook in a one-semester course on compiler design for undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. The only prerequisites for this book are familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures (lists, maps, recursion, etc.), a rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture and assembly language, and some experience with the Java programming language.A complete study of compilers could easily fill several graduate-level courses, and therefore some simplifications and compromises are necessary for a one-semester course that is accessible to undergraduate students. Following are some of the decisions made in order to accommodate the goals of this book.The book has a narrow focus as a project-oriented course on compilers. Compiler theory is kept to a minimum, but the project orientation retains the ""fun"" part of studying compilers.The source language being compiled is relatively simple, but it is powerful enough to be interesting and challenging. It has basic data types, arrays, procedures, functions, and parameters, but it relegates many other interesting language features to the project exercises.The target language is assembly language for a virtual machine with a stack-based architecture, similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This approach greatly simplifies code generation. Both an assembler and an emulator for the virtual machine are provided on the course web site.No special compiler-related tools are required or used within the book. Students require access only to a Java compiler and a text editor, but most students will want to use Java with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).One very important component of a compiler is the parser, which verifies that a source program conforms to the language syntax and produces an intermediate representation of the program that is suitable for additional analysis and code generation. There are several different approaches to parsing, but in keeping with the focus on a one-semester course, this book emphasizes only one approach, recursive descent parsing with several lookahead tokens.",John I Moore,https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo0MDAzMzE1MDE2OTI2MDYyOjE2ODA1OTgxNzQ6c3BfYXRmOjIwMDk3MjAyMDIwODk4OjowOjo&url=%2FCompiler-Design-Using-Java-Object-Oriented%2Fdp%2F1734139129%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dcompiler%2Bdesign%26qid%3D1680598174%26s%3Dbooks%26sr%3D1-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1

Machine Learning Engineering,$39.49,4.7,"From the author of a world bestseller published in eleven languages, The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book, this new book by Andriy Burkov is the most complete applied AI book out there. It is filled with best practices and design patterns of building reliable machine learning solutions that scale. Andriy Burkov has a Ph.D. in AI and is the leader of a machine learning team at Gartner. This book is based on Andriy's own 15 years of experience in solving problems with AI as well as on the published experience of the industry leaders.Here's what Cassie Kozyrkov, Chief Decision Scientist at Google tells about the book in the Foreword:""You're looking at one of the few true Applied Machine Learning books out there. That's right, you found one! A real applied needle in the haystack of research-oriented stuff. Excellent job, dear reader... unless what you were actually looking for is a book to help you learn the skills to design general-purpose algorithms, in which case I hope the author won't be too upset with me for telling you to flee now and go pick up pretty much any other machine learning book. This one is different.""[...]""So, what's in [...] the book? The machine learning equivalent of a bumper guide to innovating in recipes to make food at scale. Since you haven't read the book yet, I'll put it in culinary terms: you'll need to figure out what's worth cooking / what the objectives are (decision-making and product management), understand the suppliers and the customers (domain expertise and business acumen), how to process ingredients at scale (data engineering and analysis), how to try many different ingredient-appliance combinations quickly to generate potential recipes (prototype phase ML engineering), how to check that the quality of the recipe is good enough to serve (statistics), how to turn a potential recipe into millions of dishes served efficiently (production phase ML engineering), and how to ensure that your dishes stay top-notch even if the delivery truck brings you a ton of potatoes instead of the rice you ordered (reliability engineering). This book is one of the few to offer perspectives on each step of the end-to-end process.""[...]""One of my favorite things about this book is how fully it embraces the most important thing you need to know about machine learning: mistakes are possible... and sometimes they hurt. As my colleagues in site reliability engineering love to say, ""Hope is not a strategy."" Hoping that there will be no mistakes is the worst approach you can take. This book does so much better. It promptly shatters any false sense of security you were tempted to have about building an AI system that is more ""intelligent"" than you are. (Um, no. Just no.) Then it diligently takes you through a survey of all kinds of things that can go wrong in practice and how to prevent/detect/handle them. This book does a great job of outlining the importance of monitoring, how to approach model maintenance, what to do when things go wrong, how to think about fallback strategies for the kinds of mistakes you can't anticipate, how to deal with adversaries who try to exploit your system, and how to manage the expectations of your human users (there's also a section on what to do when your, er, users are machines). These are hugely important topics in practical machine learning, but they're so often neglected in other books. Not here.""""If you intend to use machine learning to solve business problems at scale, I'm delighted you got your hands on this book. Enjoy!""",Andriy Burkov,https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Engineering-Andriy-Burkov/dp/1999579577/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=machine+learning+engineering+books&qid=1680599041&s=books&sr=1-3

It's clear and easy to read, with loads of examples that showed my students what to do.""         -- Larry Snyder, Emeritus Professor, University of Washington, Department of Computer Science and Engineering “Having the TouchDevelop book available made our events so much easier. Students could figure things out for themselves with help from the book.” -- Jennifer Marsman, Microsoft Principal Developer EvangelistMobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are set to become the main computers that virtually all people will own and carry with them at all times. And yet,mobile devices are not yet used for all computing tasks. A project at Microsoft Research was created to answer a simple question: “It is possible to create interesting apps directly on a smartphone or tablet, without using a separate PC or a keyboard?” The result is TouchDevelop, a programming environment that runs on all modern mobile devices such as Windows Phone, iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets, and also on PCs and Macs.This book walks you through all of the screens of the TouchDevelop app, and it points out similarities and differences of the TouchDevelop language compared to other programming languages. For users, the book can serve as a handyreference next to the phone. The book systematically addresses all programming language constructs, starting from the very basic constructs such as variables and loops. The book also explores many of the phone sensors and data sources which make creating apps for mobile devices so rewarding.If you are new to programming with TouchDevelop, or if you have not yet worked on touchscreen devices, we suggest that you read the book starting from Chapter 1. If you are already familiar with the basic paradigm of the TouchDevelop programming environment, then feel free to jump ahead to the later chapters that address particular topic areas.This book is written from the perspective of a person developing their code using a web browser. The TouchDevelop Web App runs in many modern browsers on many different devices including smartphones and tablets, Macs, PC. All screenshots and navigation instructions refer to the TouchDevelop Web App running in a browser. For Windows Phone, there is a dedicated TouchDevelop app in the Windows Phone Store which gives access to many more sensors and data sources. Starting with the TouchDevelop app v3.0 for Windows Phone 8, the phone app will share the same look and navigation structure and all features of the Web App.",Nigel Horspool,https://www.amazon.com/TouchDevelop-Programming-Go-Experts-Voice-ebook/dp/B00FB2PZ52/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=web+development+books&qid=1680599628&s=books&sr=1-19

And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.
